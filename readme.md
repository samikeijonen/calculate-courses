# Calculate courses

Calculate courses is a small test case using [WP Libre Form](https://github.com/libreform/wp-libre-form). It calculates course prices based on your selected courses.

Example form template can be found in [inc/espoo-summerschool.html](inc/espoo-summerschool.html).

Note that I'm manually using that template at the moment.
